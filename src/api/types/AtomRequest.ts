/**
 * Request shape for the product-agnostic atom API.
 *
 * Frontend sends:
 * - atoms: Schema definitions for each atom type (JSON Schema format)
 * - instructions: Free-form text instructions for the agent
 * - context: Product-defined context for cache granularity (optional)
 *
 * The context field controls cache granularity:
 * - More fields → more specific cache → fewer hits, fresher data
 * - Fewer fields → broader cache → more hits, potentially staler
 *
 * Platform always injects org_id and user_id from the authenticated session.
