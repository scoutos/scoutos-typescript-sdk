/**
 * LLM judge assertion.
 *
 * Uses an LLM to evaluate the quality of the output based on criteria.
 * This is the most flexible assertion type but requires API calls.
 *
 * Example:
 *     assertion = LLMJudgeAssertion(
 *         type="llm_judge",
 *         criteria=["correctness", "helpfulness", "professionalism"],
 *         model="claude-sonnet-4",
 *         description="Response should be helpful and professional"
 *     )
