/**
 * Configuration for a single scoring dimension/criterion.
 *
 * Defines what to measure, the scoring range, and how much it contributes
 * to the composite score. Used by AgentScorer to define evaluation dimensions.
 *
 * Example:
 *     field = ScoreField(
 *         name="accuracy",
 *         description="Factual correctness of the response",
 *         min=0.0,
 *         max=100.0,
 *         weight=2.0  # Counts twice as much as other dimensions
 *     )
